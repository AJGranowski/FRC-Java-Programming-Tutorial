# Level 3 #
##### *Programming a robot in Java* #####
**At this point, it is going to be assumed that you are comfortable with programming in java. If you are not comfortable, see the [level two](level-2.md) handbook.**

Congratulations! You are now ready to program the robot! Let’s dive in, shall we?

## Setup: ##
The first thing we need to take care of is the setup of our environment. Luckily for us, FIRST posts a step by step guide for this each year.

(You will want to make sure that you follow these instructions while on a deployment platform such as a Classmate or other laptop.)

#### To access the guide, follow these steps: ####

1.	Navigate to www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc
2.	Locate “Technical Resources” in the left sidebar
3.	Hover over the button, and select “Programming” when a sub menu pops out

This should bring you to the 2016 FRC Control System page. Note that this guide has been written during 2015, so some of the steps outlined might differ from what you see.

If you are concerned with this year’s robot setup, you should read through *Getting Started With the 2016 Control System*, if not, we can simply jump to setting up the environment.

1.	Click on the hyperlink that suggests setting up Java. For 2015 this was [FRC Java Programming](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809)
2.	Follow all of the steps under Setting up the Development Environment from top to bottom. *This is important as we skipped a bunch of this and ended up a little behind in 2015.*

After following all of the instructions, you should now have either a configured Netbeans or Eclipse IDE installed on the deployment platform as well as an imaged robot.
